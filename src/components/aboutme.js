        <p className="mt-6">
                  I’m a front-end developer based in Seattle, WA.
                  I like to build intuitive and functionally aesthetic designs for different mediums of the web.
                  ‍
                  I am dedicated to implementing industry-recognized best practices in UX/FED, ensuring the development of elegant, and pixel-perfect UI designs.

                  When I'm not in front of a computer screen, I enjoy cooking, playing Tears of the Kingdom, and riding my bike.
